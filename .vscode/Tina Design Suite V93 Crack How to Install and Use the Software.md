# How to Design Electronic Circuits with Tina Design Suite V93
 
Tina Design Suite V93 is a powerful yet affordable circuit simulator, circuit designer and PCB design software package for analyzing, designing, and real time testing of analog, digital, IBIS, HDL, MCU, and mixed electronic circuits and their PCB layouts[^1^]. You can also analyze SMPS, RF, communication and optical circuits, generate and debug MCU code using the integrated flowchart tool, and test microcontroller applications in a mixed circuit environment[^1^]. In this article, we will show you how to design electronic circuits with Tina Design Suite V93 in a few simple steps.
  
## Step 1: Create a New Project
 
To start designing your circuit, you need to create a new project in Tina Design Suite V93. You can do this by clicking on the File menu and selecting New Project. You will be asked to choose a project name, location and type. You can choose from various types of projects, such as Analog Circuit, Digital Circuit, Mixed Circuit, MCU Circuit, PCB Layout and more[^1^]. For this example, we will choose Analog Circuit as the project type.

## Step 2: Draw Your Circuit Schematic
 
Once you have created your project, you can start drawing your circuit schematic using the Schematic Editor. You can access the Schematic Editor by clicking on the Schematic button on the toolbar or by pressing F3. The Schematic Editor allows you to place components, wires, labels, text and other objects on your schematic[^1^]. You can find the components you need in the Component Library, which contains more than 30,000 components from various categories[^1^]. You can also create your own components using the Macro Wizard or import them from Spice or other sources[^1^]. To place a component on your schematic, simply drag it from the Component Library and drop it on the desired location. To connect components with wires, click on the Wire button on the toolbar or press F4 and then click on the terminals of the components you want to connect. To edit the properties of a component or a wire, double-click on it or right-click and select Edit Properties. You can also use the tools on the toolbar to zoom, pan, rotate, copy, delete and align objects on your schematic[^1^]. Here is an example of a simple RC circuit drawn with Tina Design Suite V93:

                         GND

## Step 3: Run Simulation and Analysis
 
After you have drawn your circuit schematic, you can run simulation and analysis to test its performance and behavior. Tina Design Suite V93 supports various types of simulation and analysis modes, such as DC Analysis, AC Analysis, Transient Analysis, Fourier Analysis, Noise Analysis and more[^1^]. You can access these modes by clicking on the Analysis menu or by pressing F5. Depending on the mode you choose, you will be asked to enter some parameters for your simulation or analysis. For example, if you choose Transient Analysis, you will be asked to enter the start time, stop time and time step for your simulation[^1^]. After you enter the parameters and click OK, Tina Design Suite V93 will run the simulation or analysis and display the results in a graphical or tabular form. You can view the results in various ways using the tools on the toolbar or by right-clicking on the graph or table. You can also export or print the results for further use[^1^]. Here is an example of a transient analysis result for the RC circuit shown above:
  `
Time (s)   V(C1) (V)
0          0
0.001      0.632
0.002      0.865
0.003      0.950
0.004      0.982
0.005      0.993

## Step 4: Design Your PCB Layout
 
If you want to design your PCB layout based on your circuit schematic, you can use the PCB Designer tool in Tina
